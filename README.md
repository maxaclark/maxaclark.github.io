# Predicting Muscle Injuries in Professional Soccer Teams  
### Max Clark  

# Introduction  
The goal of this project is to predict the number of muscle injuries a professional soccer club will experience over the course of a season. Soccer, like many sports, is one in which the successes of any given team are often reduced to how injury-free the players remain as the year progresses. To the average viewer, therefore, it may seem little more than bad luck when a club is required to limp through a particularly injury-riddled season. I believe, however, that this isn’t the case. I’m hopeful that it may be possible to accurately predict the amount of muscle injuries a club will experience, and that a club may use these predictions to alter their strategies throughout the season.
